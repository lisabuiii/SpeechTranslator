Speech Translator is an Android application that utilizes Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to capture speeches, Google ML Kit Translation to render the transcriptions, and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to synthesize the translated transcriptions to speeches.

This was my first personal learning project, where I immersed myself in online resources to master the cloud-based APIs, which implemented natural language processing concepts. This application was inspired by my mother - an immigrant facing English conversation challenges - and I wanted to create a practical solution to empower her. While I recognize similar applications exist, the journey of constructing this one and figuring out how it all comes together through diverse information, concepts, as well as debugging - was genuinely captivating. It also propelled my understanding of building a functional Android mobile app from the ground up using APIs and Libraries.
